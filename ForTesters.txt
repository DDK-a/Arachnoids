TLDR:
Spiders only function if spawned in by the incident
Use dev mode to gain some control over the spiders behavior
There are a set of conditions for a spider to "hunt" one of your pawns. If its not happening, it may be a feature, not a bug. You can find the condition list below.


1. Spider Spawning

How spiders enter the map
	•	A spider is spawned via a custom incident
	•	When the spider spawns, an invisible “home spot” is also created
	•	The spider’s behavior is entirely anchored to this home spot
  THIS MEANS INDIVIDUAL SPIDERS SPAWNED IN BY ANY MEANS OTHER THAN THE INCIDENT WILL NOT FUNCTION!!!!

Spawn location rules
	•	The spider + home spot will spawn:
	•	20–70 tiles from a map edge
	•	Not on water
	•	Biased towards forested areas or cave entrances:
	•	They are not a traditional raid or drop-in threat

⸻

2. Spider Territory & Movement
	•	Each spider has a territory radius (about 20 tiles, can change slightly based on circumstances) centered on its home spot
	•	The spider will:
	•	Patrol within this area
	•	Defend it aggressively
	•	It will not roam the entire map

⸻

3. Hunting Behavior (Very Important)

Spiders do not constantly hunt.

When a spider will start a hunt

A hunt can only begin if:
	•	The spider is healthy enough
	•	Its hunt cooldown (2 days by default) has expired
	•	It is in Defend mode
	•	A humanlike pawn is:
	•	Within hunt range of the home spot (90 tiles by default)
	•	Somewhat isolated (<3 allies within 15 tiles of it)
	•	Not too close to the colony (30 tiles from any turret and 20 from any door)

Hunt engagement & disengagement

Once hunting:
	•	The spider will chase the target
	•	The hunt will end if:
	•	A fixed hunt timer expires
	•	The target escapes too far outside the spider’s territory
	•	The target reaches colony defenses
	•	The spider is badly injured

If a hunt fails:
	•	The next hunt cooldown is shorter, so repeated failures don’t permanently neuter it

⸻

4. Capture & Cocooning

What happens when a pawn is caught
	•	If the spider downs a pawn:
	•	It will attempt to drag them back to its home (there is a delay first)
	•	The pawn is placed into a cocoon building
	•	The pawn is DESPAWNED and stored inside the cocoon

A Spider will also attempt to cocoon any pawn which is:
	•	Downed within 20 tiles of its home spot
	•	Recently webbed
	•	This means in can sometimes cocoon pawns even if the spider is not in hunt mode

5. Cocoon Stages & Visuals

The cocoon has two visual stages:

Stage 1 – Initial Cocooning
	•	Cocooned hediff severity < 1.0
	•	The pawn is restrained, and kept alive
	•	No egging yet

Stage 2 – Fully Cocooned / Egging
	•	Happens when cocooned hediff reaches severity 1.0
	•	At this moment:
	•	Arachnophobia trait is added
	•	Egging begins after a delay
	•	An alert is fired (camera jumps to the cocoon)
  •	Cocoon texture switches after a delay (should happen soon after the first egg is implanted)
  •	The arachnophobe trait should be added
  •	The Arachnophobe trait controls many thoughts/moods related to spiders and being cocooned; removing it will affect them
  
While cocooned:
	•	Hunger is kept full
	•	Bleeding is automatically tended

Egging:
	•	The eggs will be added to the cocooned pawn every 6 hours after the second stage begins 
	•	They do not spawn the main spider, but spiderlings, a separate kind of enemy
  Spiderlings:
	•	Do not leave the nest
	•	Cannot use web
	•	Are very tiny, it may be hard to see them without the Camera+ mod

6. Arachnophobia Trait

Effects include:
	•	Negative thought when spiders are on the same map
	•	Positive mood buff when spiders are killed
	•	Trait is only given if cocooning reaches stage two

⸻

7. Releasing or Rescuing Pawns
	•	Colonists can:
	•	Destroy the cocoon
	•	Rescue the pawn directly (select a pawn, then right click the cocoon)

⸻

8. Events, Raids, and Other Incidents

Other events should happen even if an aracnoid is on the map:

This is intentional:
	•	A spider may coexist with a raid
	•	Raiders may stumble into spider territory
	•	Players can exploit this (on purpose)

⸻

9. Dev Mode Notes (for testers)

In dev/god mode:
	•	You can reset hunt cooldown to have it start another one as soon as conditions are met
	•	You can force Defend mode
